DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING IN THIS DIRECTORY. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.

* You may edit [`blur.svg`](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/core/svg/blur.svg) if you wish to change the default value of 15px.
* You may edit the `$pixelBase` value of `18` located in the [REM to PX conversion](http://davidwalsh.name/rem-px-browser-function-sass) function in [`_mixins.scss`](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/core/scss/_mixins.scss) if you wish to change your `body`'s font size located in [`_custom-global.scss`](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/scss/_custom-global.scss). That's a meaty sentence, make sure you read it carefully.
* You may delete `.js` files located in [`core/js/`](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/tree/master/core/js) if you simply don't want 'em.
